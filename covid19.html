        <p>
We are committed to keeping all of our passengers and staff safe. Please take note of the following health and safety measures in place due to COVID-19: <br>

1. Face Masks: <br>
Masks are required for all passengers and staff in all indoor areas, including check-in, security, boarding gates, and on board the aircraft. Please wear your mask properly at all times. <br>

2. Health Screening: <br>
Expect temperature checks and health screenings at various checkpoints. If you are feeling unwell or showing symptoms of COVID-19, please alert our staff immediately. <br>

3. Social Distancing: <br>
Please maintain a safe distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others wherever possible. Follow the social distancing markers in queues and seating areas. <br>

4. Testing & Vaccination: <br>
If you are traveling internationally, please ensure you have the required COVID-19 test results (PCR or rapid antigen) or proof of vaccination. Check the specific requirements for your destination before you travel. <br>

5. Quarantine and Entry Requirements: <br>
Some travelers may be subject to quarantine or entry restrictions upon arrival. Please review the entry requirements for your destination before arriving at the airport. <br>

6. Digital Health Pass: <br>
If your destination country requires it, please ensure that your digital health pass or travel app (such as IATA Travel Pass or VeriFly) is up to date with your test results or vaccination status. <br>

7. Enhanced Cleaning Protocols: <br>
Our airport is thoroughly sanitized regularly, including high-touch areas such as check-in counters, security trays, and seating areas. We also provide hand sanitizing stations throughout the terminal. <br>

8. Boarding Process: <br>
To minimize crowding, boarding will be done in smaller groups or zones. Please follow the airline’s instructions and avoid congregating in boarding areas until it's time for your flight. <br>

We ask for your patience and cooperation during your travel today. If you have any questions or concerns, please approach any of our staff members. Thank you for helping us create a safe environment for everyone! <br>
